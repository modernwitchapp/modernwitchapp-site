      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 2026-01-31</p>

      <p>
        This policy describes how Modern Witch Digital Spellbook ("the App")
        handles information. We aim to collect as little data as possible while
        still providing core app functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>Information you provide</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Account information (such as email) if you create an account.
        </li>
        <li>
          User-generated content you choose to enter in the app (such as notes or saved items).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Subscriptions and free trial</h2>
      <p>
        If you purchase a subscription, billing is handled by Apple. We do not
        receive your full payment details. Apple may provide us with subscription
        status information (active, expired, etc.) so we can unlock access.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        The App may use limited analytics to understand app performance and improve
        reliability. This may include basic usage events and crash information.
      </p>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain app features.</li>
        <li>To support subscriptions and access control.</li>
        <li>To troubleshoot issues and improve stability.</li>
        <li>To respond to support requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited information
        with service providers that help us operate the app (for example, hosting or
        analytics), only as needed to provide the service.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information only as long as needed for the purposes described above,
        unless a longer period is required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <p>
        You can stop using the app at any time. If account deletion is available in-app,
        you can use it. Otherwise, contact support to request deletion.
      </p>
