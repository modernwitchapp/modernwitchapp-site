        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Modern Witch Digital Spellbook</strong>
        ("the App") collects, uses, and handles information when you use the App.
      </p>

      <p>
        We collect only the information necessary to operate the App, provide
        subscriptions, and support users.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account information</strong>, such as an email address, if you create
          an account
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User-generated content</strong>, such as notes, saved spells, or other
          content you choose to enter into the App
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Subscription Information</h3>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not receive or store payment card details</li>
        <li>
          Apple may provide us with limited subscription status information, such as
          whether a subscription is active or expired, so we can manage access to paid
          features
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Analytics and Diagnostics</h2>
      <p>
        We collect limited analytics and diagnostic information to monitor app
        performance, identify technical issues, and improve reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may include basic usage events and crash reports. Analytics data is not
        used for advertising or marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain App functionality</li>
        <li>Manage user accounts and subscriptions</li>

        <li>Troubleshoot issues and improve performance</li>

      </p>
      <p>
        We may share limited information with trusted service providers who assist us
        with app hosting, infrastructure, and analytics. These providers are only given
        access to information necessary to perform their services.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain information only for as long as necessary to operate the App, provide
        support, or comply with legal obligations. When information is no longer
        required, it is deleted or anonymized.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using the App at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If account deletion is available within the App, you may use that option.
        Otherwise, you may request deletion of your account and associated data by
        contacting support.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
